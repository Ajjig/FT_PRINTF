# FT_PRINTF
FT_PRINTF is a 42 project that will allow me to remake the printf function (included in &lt;stdio.h>) to be able to reuse it in my next projects.
## Requirements
The function is written by C language and therefore requires the gcc compiler and certain standard C libraries to work.
To clone & compile the function:
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/Ajjig/FT_PRINTF.git && cd FT_PRINTF && make
```
*to compile the "SPACE, SHARP, PLUS" flags:
```Bash
make bonus
```
Then you can include the header file
```C
#include "<Path>/ft_printf.h"
```
